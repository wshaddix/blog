# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Steps

The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a structured process for planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. Below is a comprehensive list of SDLC phases, each with a brief description of its purpose and activities.

## 1. Requirement Analysis
**Description**: Gather and analyze project requirements to define the scope and objectives.  
- Collaborate with stakeholders (clients, end-users, management) to understand needs.  
- Document functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., features, performance, security).  
- Create requirement specifications, user stories, or use cases.  
- Validate requirements to ensure clarity, feasibility, and alignment with business goals.

## 2. Feasibility Study
**Description**: Assess the project's viability from technical, financial, and operational perspectives.  
- Evaluate technical feasibility (e.g., available technology, expertise).  
- Analyze cost-benefit and resource requirements.  
- Identify risks and constraints (e.g., time, budget, technology limitations).  
- Produce a feasibility report to guide decision-making.

## 3. System Design
**Description**: Create a blueprint for the software system based on requirements.  
- Define system architecture (e.g., monolithic, microservices, cloud-based).  
- Design components, modules, databases, and interfaces.  
- Specify tools, frameworks, and technologies to be used.  
- Create detailed design documents, including flowcharts, ER diagrams, and wireframes.

## 4. Development (Coding)
**Description**: Write code to implement the system design.  
- Assign tasks to developers based on design specifications.  
- Use programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build software components.  
- Follow coding standards and best practices (e.g., modularity, documentation).  
- Conduct regular code reviews to ensure quality and consistency.

## 5. Testing
**Description**: Verify that the software meets requirements and is free of defects.  
- Perform unit testing to validate individual components.  
- Conduct integration testing to ensure modules work together.  
- Execute system testing to verify the entire system’s functionality.  
- Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to confirm the software meets user needs.  
- Identify and fix bugs, ensuring performance, security, and usability.

## 6. Deployment
**Description**: Release the software to the production environment for end-user access.  
- Plan deployment strategy (e.g., phased rollout, big bang).  
- Set up production environments (servers, databases, configurations).  
- Deploy the software using automated tools or manual processes.  
- Monitor initial performance and address any immediate issues.

## 7. Maintenance
**Description**: Provide ongoing support to ensure the software remains functional and relevant.  
- Monitor system performance and address issues (e.g., bugs, crashes).  
- Release updates or patches to fix defects or improve functionality.  
- Incorporate user feedback to enhance features or usability.  
- Plan for scalability, security updates, and compatibility with new technologies.

## 8. Retirement (Optional)
**Description**: Decommission the software when it becomes obsolete or is replaced.  
- Plan for data migration to new systems if needed.  
- Archive code, documentation, and data for compliance or future reference.  
- Notify users and stakeholders of the software’s end-of-life.  
- Safely shut down the system and dispose of resources.
