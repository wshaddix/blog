# Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition - how classes and objects are combined to form larger structures.

## Patterns Covered

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Adapter | Convert interface to another interface clients expect |
| Bridge | Separate abstraction from implementation |
| Composite | Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly |
| Decorator | Add responsibilities dynamically |
| Facade | Provide unified interface to subsystem |
| Flyweight | Share common state between objects |
| Proxy | Provide placeholder for another object |
