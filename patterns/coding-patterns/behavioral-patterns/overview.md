# Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Patterns Covered

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Chain of Responsibility | Pass request along chain of handlers |
| Command | Encapsulate request as object |
| Iterator | Access elements sequentially |
| Mediator | Define simplified communication between objects |
| Memento | Capture and restore object state |
| Observer | Notify dependents of state changes |
| State | Alter behavior when state changes |
| Strategy | Define family of interchangeable algorithms |
| Template Method | Define algorithm skeleton, defer steps |
| Visitor | Add operations to objects without modifying them |
