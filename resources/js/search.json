A scope is a phrase describing a section of the codebase enclosed in parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser):","A description MUST immediately follow the type/scope prefix.

The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.","A footer MAY be provided one blank line after the body. The footer SHOULD contain additional issue references about the code changes (such as the issues it fixes, e.g., Fixes #13).","Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the footer AND by appending a ! after the type/scope. A BREAKING CHANGE introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.","A description MUST be provided after the BREAKING CHANGE:, describing what has changed about the API, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files.","The footer MUST only contain BREAKING CHANGE, external links, issue references, and other meta-information.","Types other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages."]}],[{"l":".Net CLI"}],[{"l":"Overview"}],[{"l":"Overview"}],[{"l":"Blog"}],[{"l":"This is a good post"}],[{"l":"Tailwind 4 with Asp.Net"}]]
