# C# and .NET

C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. Combined with the .NET platform, it's one of the most versatile ecosystems for building applications.

## Why C#?

- **Versatile:** Build web apps, APIs, desktop apps, mobile apps, games, cloud services
- **Modern features:** Async/await, LINQ, pattern matching, records
- **Strong typing:** Catch errors at compile time
- **Great tooling:** Visual Studio, VS Code, JetBrains Rider
- **Enterprise-ready:** Used by countless businesses for production systems
- **Active development:** Regular language updates with new features
