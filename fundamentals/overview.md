# Computer Science Fundamentals

This section covers the foundational computer science concepts that every software engineer should understand. These concepts transcend any specific programming language and form the bedrock of software engineering expertise.

## Why Fundamentals Matter

Understanding fundamentals gives you:

- **Problem-solving frameworks** - Recognize which data structure or algorithm fits a problem
- **Performance intuition** - Know why code is slow before profiling
- **Interview readiness** - Most technical interviews test these concepts
- **Language agility** - Move between languages easily when you understand the underlying concepts

## What's Covered

### Data Structures

The building blocks for organizing and storing data efficiently:

- [Arrays](/fundamentals/data-structures/arrays) - Contiguous memory, random access
- [Linked Lists](/fundamentals/data-structures/linked-lists) - Dynamic size, sequential access
- [Stacks & Queues](/fundamentals/data-structures/stacks-queues) - LIFO and FIFO structures
- [Hash Tables](/fundamentals/data-structures/hash-tables) - Key-value lookup in O(1)
- [Trees & Graphs](/fundamentals/data-structures/trees-graphs) - Hierarchical and networked data

### Algorithms

Techniques for solving computational problems:

- [Big O Notation](/fundamentals/algorithms/big-o-notation) - Analyzing time and space complexity
- [Sorting](/fundamentals/algorithms/sorting) - Ordering data efficiently
- [Searching](/fundamentals/algorithms/searching) - Finding data quickly
- [Recursion](/fundamentals/algorithms/recursion) - Solving problems by breaking them down

### Programming Concepts

Core programming paradigms and principles:

- [OOP Principles](/fundamentals/programming-concepts/oop-principles) - SOLID, DRY, encapsulation
- [Functional Concepts](/fundamentals/programming-concepts/functional-concepts) - Immutability, pure functions
- [Concurrency](/fundamentals/programming-concepts/concurrency) - Parallel and async programming

## How to Use This Section

Each topic includes:

1. **Theory** - The concept explained clearly
2. **Visualizations** - Diagrams to build mental models
3. **Practical Examples** - Links to C# implementations in the [C# section](/csharp/overview)
4. **Practice Problems** - Exercises to solidify understanding

*Start with [Big O Notation](/fundamentals/algorithms/big-o-notation) if you're new - it's the language we use to discuss everything else.*
