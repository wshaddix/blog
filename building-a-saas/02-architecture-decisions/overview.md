# Chapter 2: Architecture Decisions

Good architecture enables teams to move fast while maintaining quality. Here we make key decisions for our SaaS platform.

## What We'll Cover

- Layered architecture choices
- When to use which patterns
- Monolith vs microservices (spoiler: we start monolith)
- CQRS and when it makes sense
- Dependency injection setup

## Our Architecture

<!-- TODO: Clean Architecture / Vertical Slices hybrid -->

## Why Monolith First?

<!-- TODO: Premature optimization, splitting later -->

## Patterns We'll Use

<!-- TODO: Repository, CQRS-lite, MediatR decision -->

## Dependency Injection

<!-- TODO: Service registration, lifetimes -->

## Key Principles

1. **Simplicity first** - Don't add patterns until you need them
2. **Testability** - Architecture should make testing easy
3. **Boundaries** - Clear separation between concerns
4. **Flexibility** - Easy to change decisions later
