# DevOps

DevOps bridges development and operations, focusing on automation, collaboration, and continuous delivery.

## What's Covered

### Version Control

Source code management and collaboration:

- [Git Fundamentals](/devops/version-control/git-installation) - Setup and basics
- [Git Configuration](/devops/version-control/git-configuration) - Customizing your workflow
- [Git Recipes](/devops/version-control/git-recipes) - Common tasks and solutions
- [Conventional Commits](/devops/version-control/conventional-commits) - Standardized commit messages

### CI/CD

Automating build, test, and deployment:

- [CI/CD Concepts](/devops/ci-cd/concepts) - Continuous integration and delivery
- [GitHub Actions](/devops/ci-cd/github-actions) - Automation with GitHub
- [Azure DevOps](/devops/ci-cd/azure-devops) - Microsoft's CI/CD platform

### Containerization

Packaging applications for consistent deployment:

- [Docker Fundamentals](/devops/containerization/docker-fundamentals) - Containers and images
- [Docker Compose](/devops/containerization/docker-compose) - Multi-container applications
- [Container Best Practices](/devops/containerization/best-practices) - Production-ready containers

### Azure

Microsoft's cloud platform:

- [Azure Overview](/devops/azure/overview) - Services for .NET developers
- [App Service](/devops/azure/app-service) - Hosting web applications
- [Azure SQL](/devops/azure/azure-sql) - Managed database
- [Azure Functions](/devops/azure/functions) - Serverless compute

### Monitoring

Observability and incident response:

- [Logging](/devops/monitoring/logging) - Structured logging, log aggregation
- [Metrics](/devops/monitoring/metrics) - Application and infrastructure metrics
- [Alerting](/devops/monitoring/alerting) - Proactive incident detection

## DevOps Principles

1. **Automate everything** - Reduce manual steps, increase reliability
2. **Fail fast** - Catch issues early in the pipeline
3. **Monitor proactively** - Know about problems before users do
4. **Infrastructure as code** - Version control your infrastructure
5. **Continuous improvement** - Measure and optimize

## Learning Path

1. Master [Git](/devops/version-control/git-installation) - Foundation of collaboration
2. Learn [Docker](/devops/containerization/docker-fundamentals) - Consistent environments
3. Set up [CI/CD](/devops/ci-cd/concepts) - Automate deployments
4. Understand [Azure](/devops/azure/overview) - Cloud hosting
5. Apply in [Building a SaaS: Deployment](/building-a-saas/11-deployment/overview) - Real-world deployment
