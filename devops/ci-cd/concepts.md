# CI/CD Concepts

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery automate the path from code to production.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

<!-- TODO: Frequent merges, automated builds, automated tests -->

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

<!-- TODO: Always deployable, automated deployment pipeline -->

## Continuous Deployment

<!-- TODO: Automatic production deploys, feature flags -->

## Pipeline Stages

<!-- TODO: Build, test, deploy, typical pipeline structure -->

## Best Practices

<!-- TODO: Fast feedback, idempotent deployments, rollback capability -->

## Practical Examples

- See [Building a SaaS: Deployment](/building-a-saas/11-deployment/overview) - CI/CD in practice
