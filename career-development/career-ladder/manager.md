## Comparison: Manager vs Director

| Dimension | Manager | Director |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Team size** | 5-12 engineers (single team) | 15-50+ engineers (multiple teams) |
| **Direct reports** | Individual contributors | Managers and/or senior ICs |
| **Span** | One squad or product area | Multiple squads, a domain, or product line |
| **Reports to** | Director or Senior Director | VP or Senior Director |
| **Planning horizon** | Sprint to quarterly | Quarterly to annual |
| **Budget authority** | Typically none | May own headcount and tooling budget |
| **Hiring** | Screens and interviews for their team | Defines hiring strategy, approves offers across teams |
| **Technical involvement** | Deep—reviews PRs, participates in design | Broader—sets standards, approves architecture |
| **Performance mgmt** | Writes reviews, manages PIPs, promotes ICs | Calibrates across teams, promotes managers |
| **Process ownership** | Implements team processes | Defines org-wide engineering processes |
| **Stakeholder mgmt** | Product manager, design lead, adjacent teams | Multiple PMs, senior leadership, cross-functional execs |
| **Incident response** | Leads team response, on-call escalation | Oversees response, handles escalations to leadership |

### Key Differences Summary

| Dimension | Manager | Director |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Metaphor | Team captain on the field | Coach managing multiple teams |
| Success metric | Team velocity, quality, retention | Org-wide delivery, manager effectiveness, strategic impact |
| Failure mode | Team misses deadlines, attrition | Cross-team misalignment, poor manager development, unclear strategy |

## Transition to Director

### Timeline
Typically 3-5 years as a manager, though varies by company size and growth rate.

### Key Shifts Required

| From (Manager) | To (Director) |
|----------------|---------------|
| Owning a team | Owning a domain |
| Solving problems | Defining which problems to solve |
| Executing the roadmap | Shaping the roadmap |
| Managing ICs | Managing managers |
| Team metrics | Org-wide metrics |
| Tactical decisions | Strategic decisions |

### Key Actions to Make the Transition

**1. Build Leadership Bench**
- Identify and develop future leads/managers on your team
- Delegate increasingly complex responsibilities
- Create a team that can operate without you in the room

*Example: Identify a senior engineer with leadership potential. Give them ownership of a project, let them run standups, and coach them through people challenges. Advocate for their promotion to tech lead.*

**2. Expand Your Scope Intentionally**
- Volunteer for cross-team initiatives
- Lead projects that span multiple squads
- Own a company-wide technical or process initiative

*Example: Propose and lead a company-wide initiative to improve CI/CD pipeline performance. Coordinate with 3 teams, present progress to leadership, and deliver measurable improvements.*

**3. Develop Strategic Thinking**
- Propose roadmap items, not just execute them
- Write strategy docs connecting team work to business outcomes
- Present quarterly plans to leadership

*Example: Write a proposal for a new technical investment, including business case, resource requirements, and expected outcomes. Present it to your Director and VP for approval.*

**4. Build Cross-Functional Relationships**
- Partner directly with senior PMs, Design leads, and other Directors
- Become a trusted advisor outside your immediate team
- Understand the business deeply (revenue, customers, market)

*Example: Schedule regular coffee chats with Directors from other departments. Learn about their challenges and find ways to collaborate. Become the go-to engineering contact for product leadership.*

**5. Get Exposure to "Director-Level" Problems**
- Ask your Director to include you in org planning
- Participate in headcount and budget discussions
- Handle escalations that would normally go to your Director

*Example: Ask to attend quarterly planning sessions. Volunteer to present your team's roadmap. Take notes on how Directors discuss tradeoffs and priorities.*

**6. Demonstrate Manager-of-Managers Skills**
- Mentor tech leads or new managers informally
- Lead calibration discussions for your team
- Show you can coach others on people management

*Example: When a peer becomes a new manager, offer to be their mentor. Meet weekly to help them navigate challenges like difficult 1:1s, performance issues, and team dynamics.*

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Staying too hands-on technically (can't let go)
- Only focusing on your team's success vs. org success
- Not building relationships with senior leadership
- Waiting to be promoted instead of operating at the next level
