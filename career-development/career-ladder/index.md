## Universal Accelerators (Apply to All Transitions)

| # | Accelerator | IC → Manager | Manager → Director | Director → VP |
|---|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Find a sponsor at the next level** | A manager who advocates for you to lead projects | A Director who includes you in org-level decisions | A VP/CTO who champions you for exec roles |
| 2 | **Take on stretch assignments** | Lead a project, mentor juniors, own a system | Lead cross-team initiatives, manage a manager | Own P&L, lead a reorg, drive M&A diligence |
| 3 | **Get feedback early and often** | From your manager on leadership potential | From your Director and skip-level on strategic thinking | From CEO/CTO on executive presence |
| 4 | **Study leaders you admire** | Observe how good managers run teams | Observe how Directors navigate orgs | Observe how VPs influence at the exec level |
| 5 | **Operate at the next level before the title** | Act like a tech lead before being one | Make Director-level decisions when possible | Think and communicate like a VP |
| 6 | **Change companies if needed** | Sometimes faster path to first management role | Growth-stage companies often promote faster | VP roles often require external moves |

## Transition-Specific Accelerators

### IC → Manager
- Build credibility through technical excellence first—it gives you authority as a new manager
- Practice giving feedback to peers before you have direct reports
- Shadow your manager—ask to join their 1:1s, planning sessions, or hiring discussions
- Be explicit about your interest—don't assume your manager knows you want to manage

### Manager → Director
- Deliver results through your team, not despite them—prove you can scale
- Build relationships with senior leadership before you need them
- Develop a point of view on engineering strategy, not just execution

### Director → VP
- Build an external brand (speaking, writing, recruiting presence)
- Learn the language of the business—revenue, margins, market dynamics
- Get comfortable with ambiguity and making high-stakes decisions with incomplete information

## Career Path Considerations

| Dimension | IC Track | Management Track |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Ceiling | Distinguished/Fellow Engineer | CTO/VP |
| Satisfaction from | Technical mastery, hard problems | Team success, people growth |
| Risk | Obsolescence if skills stagnate | Burnout from people challenges |
| Reversibility | Can switch to management | Harder to return to IC (skills atrophy) |
