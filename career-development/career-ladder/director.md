# Director of Software Engineering

As a Director, you shift from managing a single team to owning a domain across multiple teams. Your primary focus is on cross-team strategy and organizational health. You answer the question: **"What should we build and why?"**

---

## Core Responsibilities

### Strategic Leadership
- Define and execute the technical vision aligned with business objectives
- Own the engineering roadmap and prioritization across multiple teams
- Drive architectural decisions and technical standards
- Manage engineering budgets and resource allocation

### People Management
- Lead and mentor engineering managers and senior ICs
- Build, scale, and retain high-performing engineering teams
- Conduct performance reviews, career development, and succession planning
- Foster an inclusive, collaborative engineering culture

### Execution & Delivery
- Ensure on-time, high-quality delivery of products and features
- Establish and track engineering KPIs (velocity, quality, reliability)
- Manage cross-functional dependencies and remove blockers
- Balance technical debt reduction with feature development

### Organizational
- Partner with Product, Design, and other stakeholders on strategy
- Communicate engineering status and risks to executive leadership
- Represent engineering in company-wide planning and decisions
- Drive process improvements and operational excellence

## Comparison: Director vs VP

| Dimension | Director | VP |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| **Team size** | 15-50+ engineers (multiple teams) | 100-500+ engineers (entire org or division) |
| **Direct reports** | Managers and/or senior ICs | Directors, Senior Directors |
| **Span** | Multiple squads, a domain, or product line | Entire engineering function or major division |
| **Reports to** | VP or Senior Director | CTO, CEO, or Board |
| **Planning horizon** | Quarterly to annual | Annual to multi-year |
| **Budget authority** | May own headcount and tooling budget | Sets and defends org-wide budget |
| **Hiring** | Defines hiring strategy, approves offers across teams | Defines headcount strategy, approves senior hires |
| **Technical involvement** | Sets standards, approves architecture | Relies on Directors for technical details |
| **Focus** | 60% execution, 40% strategy | 30% execution, 70% strategy |
| **External presence** | Internal-focused | Often external-facing (conferences, recruiting brand, partnerships) |
| **Board/Exec exposure** | Occasional updates | Regular board presentations, exec staff member |

### Activity Time Comparison

| Activity Type | Director | VP |
|---------------|----------|-----|
| 1:1s with managers | 4-6 hrs/week | 3-4 hrs/week |
| Cross-functional meetings | 5-8 hrs/week | 8-12 hrs/week |
| Exec/Board meetings | Rare | 4-8 hrs/week |
| Technical reviews | 3-5 hrs/week | 1-2 hrs/week |
| Strategic planning | 4-6 hrs/week | 8-12 hrs/week |
| Hiring/interviews | 2-4 hrs/week | 2-3 hrs/week |
| Incident response | As needed | Major incidents only |

### Key Differences Summary

| Dimension | Director | VP |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Metaphor | Coach managing multiple teams | General manager running the franchise |
| Success metric | Org-wide delivery, manager effectiveness, strategic impact | Business outcomes, org health, talent retention at scale |
| Failure mode | Cross-team misalignment, poor manager development, unclear strategy | Missed business targets, executive credibility loss, org dysfunction |

**Key distinction**: A Director is a "player-coach" who remains closer to execution and technical decisions. A VP is primarily an executive leader focused on organizational strategy, culture, and business outcomes.

## Transition to VP

### Timeline
Typically 4-7 years as a Director/Senior Director.

### Key Shifts Required

| From (Director) | To (VP) |
|-----------------|---------|
| Owning a domain | Owning the function |
| Influencing strategy | Setting strategy |
| Managing managers | Building the leadership team |
| Internal focus | Internal + external presence |
| Quarterly planning | Multi-year vision |
| Engineering metrics | Business metrics |

### Key Actions to Make the Transition

**1. Think Like an Executive**
- Understand the full P&L, not just engineering costs
- Frame engineering decisions in terms of business impact
- Develop opinions on company strategy, not just engineering strategy

*Example: Before proposing a major infrastructure investment, build a business case showing ROI: "This $500K investment in platform reliability will reduce customer churn by X%, saving $2M annually."*

**2. Build Executive Relationships**
- Partner directly with VP/C-level peers in Product, Sales, Finance
- Earn trust of the CEO/CTO as a strategic thought partner
- Navigate board-level discussions and investor expectations

*Example: Schedule monthly lunch meetings with the VP of Product and VP of Sales. Understand their challenges and find ways engineering can help. Become a trusted partner, not just a service provider.*

**3. Own Organizational Design**
- Lead a reorg or team restructure
- Define career ladders and leveling frameworks
- Shape engineering culture at scale

*Example: Propose and lead a reorganization to better align teams with product areas. Define the new structure, manage the transition, communicate changes, and measure the impact on delivery and retention.*

**4. Develop External Presence**
- Speak at conferences, write blog posts
- Become a talent magnet for senior hires
- Represent the company in technical partnerships

*Example: Submit a talk proposal to a major conference about a technical challenge your team solved. Write blog posts about engineering culture. Become known in the industry as a thought leader.*

**5. Handle Ambiguity and Crisis**
- Lead through major incidents, layoffs, or pivots
- Make high-stakes decisions with incomplete information
- Maintain team morale during uncertainty

*Example: When a major production incident occurs, take charge of the executive response. Communicate with the board, manage customer communications, and lead the post-mortem that results in systemic improvements.*

**6. Demonstrate Scalable Leadership**
- Build a strong Director bench that operates autonomously
- Create systems and processes that scale beyond your direct involvement
- Show you can grow the org 2-3x without proportional effort increase

*Example: Develop your Directors so well that they can run their domains without your daily involvement. Create processes for hiring, onboarding, and performance management that scale.*

**7. Get P&L or Business Ownership**
- Own a product line end-to-end (engineering, budget, outcomes)
- Drive build-vs-buy decisions with financial accountability
- Partner on M&A technical due diligence

*Example: Take ownership of a product P&L, not just the engineering budget. Be accountable for revenue and cost targets. Present quarterly results to the executive team.*

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Staying too focused on engineering vs. business outcomes
- Not building a strong enough leadership bench
- Avoiding organizational politics (you must navigate them)
- Lack of executive communication skills
- Not developing external presence and network
